What is machine learning?
- a program that can learn from data and improve its performance over time
- a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed (Arthur Samuel, 1959)

Q: What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
A: Supervised learning: the computer is given a set of inputs and the desired outputs, and the goal is to learn a mapping from the inputs to the outputs
Unsupervised learning: the computer is given a set of inputs and the goal is to find some structure in the inputs

Supervised learning: regression and classification
- input x (Feature variable) -> output y (target variable)
- learning from right answers
- regression: predicting a continuous value (how complex the solution can get is on the programmer) EX: predicting the price of a house
    -predicts numerical values
    -infinitely many possible outputs
- classification: predicting a discrete value (how complex the solution can get is on the programmer)  EX: predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign
    -predicts categorical values
    -finite/small number of possible outputs

Unsupervised learning: clustering and dimensionality reduction
- input x  // learning from patterns in the data // no teacher // no right or wrong answers
- clustering: grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups (clusters) EX: grouping customers by purchasing behavior
- dimensionality reduction: reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables (EX: PCA)

Jupyter notebook: a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text

Terminology: look at the image in directory
- training set: the set of examples used to train a model
- test set: the set of examples used to evaluate a model
